# NIH RePORTER data sourcing and preprocessing & SQL database design

This project aims at exploring gender disparities in science based on [NIH RePORTER](https://exporter.nih.gov/ExPORTER_Catalog.aspx?sid=1&index=0) project data from 1985 to 2021.

It is supported by the [Canada Research Chair on the Transformations of Scholarly Communication](https://crctcs.openum.ca/en) (Prof. Vincent Larivi√®re).

Goal of phase 1: deliver code to download the dataset, enhance it and build a relational database to allow usage by CRCTS team members.
